                The implementation of this project is targeted at increasing the number of shuttles and also extends the routes of the students’ shuttle system to areas such as Bomso, Ayeduase, Kotei, etc. This further enhances students’ security as they commute from campus to their various residence on and off-campus improving accessibility and safety.
